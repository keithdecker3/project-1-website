                <h3 class="learn-blog-header">Learning about git 2/2/18</h3>
                <p class="learn-paragraph">Today I learned about git repositories. I set the stage by simplifying my dock and desktop. I also turned my phone to silent and have all social media notifications turned off.</p>
                <p class="learn-paragraph">I wanted to learn about git repositories because it is an essential tool for developers. It allows developers to share files freely without having to allow write access. This allows for collaboration as well as a history of revisions in case bugs are found.</p>
                <p class="learn-paragraph">Once I understood how forking and cloning works a lot of learning git came down to CLI commands. This is where play comes in. At first it was frustrating whenever I would enter something in the CLI wrong because I would have to start over. What I realized though is that the more I did something wrong and had to repeat it, the better I learned that part. I am beginning to realize that I learn a lot from my mistakes and I tend to forget things that I get through quickly without any trouble.</p>
                <p class="learn-paragraph">Now that I have an understanding of this code I can now experiment with local repositories without the fear of doing something that is difficult to revert back. I now have a tool to make anything I create open source and I am beginning to build examples of my skill that I can later use to build my resume.</p>

                <h3>2/6/18 Flexbox and semantic HTML</h3>
                <p>Today I focused on learning flexbox and semantic HTML. I set the stage by cleaning up my desktop, putting my phone on silent, and turning all social media notifications off.</p>
                <p>I wanted to learn semantic HTML because it is easier for other developers to understand, it is machine readable, and it is better for accessability. I wanted to get better at flexbox so that I can properly position HTML elements on my webpage.</p>
                <p>I attended a breakout on semantic HTML which really helped me understand some basic rules about the meaning behind some of the more common HTML elements. I was able to dig a little deeper as I worked on the website drills by referencing MDN web docs. Getting better at flexbox came down to playing around with the developer tools. The developer tools allowed me to make temporary changes before changing my css and understand exactly how changes to the flexbox display would alter my website. Prior to that I was switching back and forth between vscode and chrome and I had trouble understanding what elements flexbox was affecting. The developer tools made that much more clear and it was easier to identify problems.</p>
                <p>Now that I have a decent understanding of flexbox and semantic HTML I want to learn more about grid. I see where flexbox is a bit limited at times and I want to be able to do more complex positioning without having to create a lot of containers. I noticed that it is a lot easier to maintain good semantic HTML when I use less containers.</p>

                <h3>2/13/18 Learning javascript</h3>
                <p>Today I wanted to learn more about javascript. Specifically javascript objects. I set the stage by clearing my desktop of all distractions, putting my phone on silent, and silencing slack notifications.</p>
                <p>I wanted to learn more about javascript because I think it is pretty neat to be able to tell computers to do things for me. I am really interested in learning about objects and nested values because it seems like it brings me a lot closer to understanding real-life applications of javascript.</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about accessing nested values in objects today but I also learned a lot about how to approach and troubleshoot code. I have been using repl.it so far to experiment with code but today I learned how to play with code using the CLI and node tests. It is really great having tests set up with the galvanize-money drill because it makes it very clear what I need to do next or what my code is missing. Error messages are great but tests are even better. Matt also did a great job explaining some of the ways he likes to approach coding challenges. Rather than try to write code all at once that can pass all of the requirements, it can be beneficial to break it down into pieces and use console.log often to make sure it is doing everything you think it is doing. I think this allows for more intentional experimentation and makes it a lot easier to identify problems when they come up.</p>
                <p> have noticed in the past few days that slack can be distracting at times. There is a lot of fun to be had with other cohort members on slack but the notifications can make me spend more time there than I want to. I have started to turn off notifications while working so that checking funny gifs and such on slack is more of a planned break than an ongoing distraction.</p>
                <p>Now that I have learned the value of tests and node I am really interested in learning how to build my own tests in the future. Learning to work with objects is exciting because I am starting to understand how I can sort through very large amounts of data using javascript. I want to understand how objects and data sorting is used in a work environment now. I have learned a lot about javascript in the past couple of days but I feel like there are still a lot of built in methods to discover. Every time I run into a problem and get on google I seem to learn a few new methods.</p>
