            <h3>Keith Decker - Comitted to Learning</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer with a background in sales and business development.  My experience working in the rapidly growing craft beer industry combined with my ability to learn quickly make me a strong candidate for scaling tech companies.  I am fueled by a passion for knowledge.  My commitment to a lifetime of learning has led to an interest in technology as well as a desire to grow my academic foundation of business.</p>
            <p>My interest in local business led me to my most recent success at Renegade Brewing Company where I took on the role of sales manager.  I helped scale the company from a taproom oriented brewery into a larger production facility serving five states.  During that time I learned a lot about keeping a team close as a business grows and the importanice of building relatioships outside of a company.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am attending a coding bootcamp at Galvanize.  I have found that I thrive in an environment of assisted self-teaching and I now have an understanding of Html, Css, and Javascript.  I have developed strong strategies for learning and have reinforced my ability to work as a team and tackle complex problems.</p>
            <p>I am excited to continue my journey and accomplish my current goal of becoming a full-stack developer.  Reach out to me at kdecker09@gmail.com to connect!</p>
