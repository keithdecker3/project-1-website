            <h3>2/6/2018 "Let it Raine" Blockchain meetup with Raine Revere</h3>
            <p>I attended this meetup to try and understand blockchain technology a little bit more. I was specifically interested in ethereum. I spoke with Raine Revere who is the former lead architect of shapeshift prism and is a co-founder of the non-profit maiden. I also met Shira who is the other co-founder of Maiden. Maiden is a non-profit focused on diversifying blockchain leadership. I met a UX designer named Juwon but didn't take note of the business she works at.</p>
            <p>The meetup started with Raine talking about the basics of blockchain technology. She explained that there is a public ledger and walked us through using a hardware wallet. I learned that blockchain is not anonymous but it is pseudonymous meaning that sending coins is basically like writing under a pseudonym. An interesting thing I learned about ethereum is that there it actually has a programming language attached called Solidity. We can build interesting applications as developers but we often depend on third parties to make those applications run. Raine explained that is something that we take for granted and an interesting thing about Ethereum is that we can build applications and smart contracts that do not require that third party to run. I also learned that I need to take better notes of the people that I am meeting so that I can connect with them later.</p>
            <p>I walked away with a lot of questions. One of the bigger questions is I want a better understanding of how the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM works. My understanding is that the EVM is a big part of what makes etherum special. I want to know how developers can use that system to build apps. I also want to gain a better understanding of smart contracts. That is another interesting application of Ethereum that I do not understand well. The last thing I would like to learn is some selling points for Ethereum and blochchain in general. I believe in diversifying leadership in tech but at the moment I don't understand blockchain enough to be comfortable talking friends into getting involved.</p>

            <h3>2/14/18 Develop Happy Hour</h3>
            <p>This meetup was a social happy hour for the Denver/Boulder tech scene. There was no speaker or agenda. It was just an opportunity to meet people in the tech scene over drinks.</p>
            <p>I talked to a lot of people at this meetup but some of the people I talked to the most were Greg Svitak who is the CTO of Complion, Alex Seplowe who is an associate software engineer at Charles Schwab, Josh Foley who is a freelance developer, and Shannon Buys.</p>
            <p>One of the main takeaways from this meetup was that Denver really does have a great supportive meetup community. I found that people were very approachable and they genuinely wanted to help and give out advice. I spoke with Shannon and Greg at length about advice for a current bootcamper. One piece of advice they gave me was to go to a hackathon, create something, and show off that code in an interview. They said hackathon code is great because it shows that you can improvise something on a tight deadline which is a desired ability in the professional world. They also reinforced the idea that the best thing you can learn at a bootcamp is how to learn. I continue to hear that over and over even outside of Galvanize. I did a much better time this time of connecting with people on linked in, getting their number, or even just asking for their denverdevs slack handle in this case.</p>
            <p>Josh Foley was great to talk to about the overall perception of a bootcamper versus a computer science graduate. He is a CU computer science graduate and he told me that there are certainly people that have mixed feelings about boot camps and that he feels he has certainly had an advantage applying for jobs with his computer science degree. However, he disagrees with that mentality. He was very encouraging in the fact that he believes people who come out of bootcamps are better developers. He thinks that bootcamps such as Galvanize do a great job of adapting to the professional world and he values their focus on good practices. In contrast he said that he is glad he has a good understanding of the fundamentals from his degree, but that he spent a lot of time learning things that he really doesn't utilize. A lot of the technology he uses now he had to learn outside of school and he feels that people coming out of computer science degrees don't always understand how to write clear code that is easy for other developers to understand. Overall, I keep hearing that being a good developer is all about being comfortable with a lifetime of learning. Some of the most valuable elements of a bootcamp are learning to work in a team environment, and making peace with always having to learn new technologies.</p>
            <p>I have a couple questions moving forward. One thing I want to learn is what are some of the major paths forward after this program. I am excited to go through the full stack experience and I want to get better at telling people what I want to do once I graduate. I don't know if I have an answer to that question that I am confident in yet. Another question is I want to learn more about how hackathons work. What level of proficiency do I need to be at to attend an event like that?</p>
