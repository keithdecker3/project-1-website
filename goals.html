        <h2>Setting Goals and Reflection</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>2/2/18 Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit the first HTML/CSS drill</li>
                <li>Gain understanding of flexbox and use it in the drill</li>
                <li>Gain an understanding of semantic HTML and utilize it</li>
                <li>Get to at least level 15 in flexbox froggy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I did not complete my first drill but the other goals were met.</p>
            <p>The main way I learned how flexbox worked was by experimentation. I learned commenting out code is a great way to try something with no risk. Semantic HTML was tricky at first but I learned that MDN web docs is a great resource for understanding exactly when to use an element. One thing that didn't go according to plan was it took longer than expected to finish my first drill. One thing I need to do better is manage how much time I spend on something I am having trouble with. After wrestling with something long enough I should probably learn to make better use of the queue or other classmates. Tomorrow I think will try to find good example websites to better understand different use cases for flexbox as well as get a better understanding of good practices for assigning classes.</p>

            <h3>2/6/18 Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit the second web pages drill</li>
                <li>Attend the blockchain technology meetup and meet 3 new people</li>
                <li>get to at least level 15 on the grid game</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I didn't quite finish the second drill but I am close. The other goals were met.</p>
            <p>One of the best things I learned today was I started using the developer tools in chrome. This really helps to make sure that css is applying correctly to elements and it lets me make temporary changes that can easily undone with a hard reset. Another win was making myself sit beside people that I don't know at the meetup. At first I sat beside a couple of people I knew but after the break we all split up and sat beside new people. I immediately struck up conversation with people around me and met people I may not have talked to otherwise. One place I fell short was I didn't take great notes of the people that I met during the meetup. Next time I will bring a notebook and make a point to ask for business cards so that I can connect with people again if needed. Tomorrow I am going to make better use of developer tools when working on the last web pages drill. Constantly switching between vscode and chrome takes up time. Using the developer tools to identify the problem before going back and making modifications is a much more effecient way to troubleshoot problems.</p>

            <h3>2/9/18 Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a Habitica character to help create goals and accountability</li>
                <li>Learn about firebase and submit at least one drill</li>
                <li>Learn at least two new things that javascript can do.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>I completed all goals</p>
            <p>I started the day by making a habitica character to help set goals. I set a lot of habits that revolve around the bootcamp such as submitting drills, helping classmates, studying vs procrastinating, etc. I also set some personal goals such as meditation and stretching. Having a character to level up based on completing goals has already been surprisingly fun. Firebase was pretty straightforward when I had the practice up to follow along with. After the first two I challenged myself to launch the last example site based on memory alone. I made a couple mistakes and had to restart but I believe that it helped me retain the knowledge better. I ran through some of the practice material for javascript after that. Some of it was familiar from precourse work and self-teaching but objects were pretty new to me. I learned how to create objects in javascript and access values using dot notation and square bracket notation.</p>
            <p>Overall I would say that finding a fun way to track goals and create accountability was a solid win today. I also learned that resources are great but if I don't challenge myself to use my memory that can lead to less retention of the material which is what I saw happening with the firebase drills. I learned that I tend to try and write all of the code for a javascript challenge at once which makes it hard to troubleshoot if it doesn't work. I learned that using something like repl.it and comments allows me to isolate the parts of the code that I don't understand and be more intentional with what I am learning.</p>
